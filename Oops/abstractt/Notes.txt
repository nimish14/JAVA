Abstract classes:
The parent class will give only the function name. A generalized form of it, not the body.
Just giving the definition, not the body.
These are known as abstract methods.(Which do not have a body).
Now it will totally depend on the child class to implement it.
If a class contains one or more abstract methods, it should be declared as abstract.

Now these methods are overriden and implemented by the child class using method overriding.

Syntax:

abstract class Abc
{ 
abstract void show();
}

We cannot create abstract constructors.
We cannot create abstract static methods. Static methods cannot to be overriden. Abstrat methods need to be overriden. So it doesnt make any sense
We cannot use final keyword for abstract classes because it prevents it from extension.
We can create static methods though since we will be caling them through the class name
